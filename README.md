The Iowa Hacker Workshop

The point of this project is to plan and create a space in downtown iowa city dedicated to fostering the local tech community and ecosystem.  Let's say you were given `absolute` creative control...what does it look like?


The place for everyone curious about technology to come and hang out.  _The_ place we all technology people love.  A place to learn, to teach and grow ideas together.

Weâ€™ve been typing in suggestions for this here, and we invite everyone to come and contribute to building up that perfect space (just send a pull request).
